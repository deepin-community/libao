libao (1.2.2+20180113-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Cherry pick upstream fix for the pulse plugin, and proposed upstream patch
    to better sanity check all memory allocations.
  * Don't build the esd plugin anymore, the GNOME maintainers want to kill off
    esound for Buster.  Closes: #856082
  * Build for multiarch.  Closes: #638741

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Jan 2018 20:28:42 +1030

libao (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build the sndio plugin, now that it's included in Debian too.
    It's not entirely clear whether "provide every possible plugin on every
    platform" really is a good thing to be doing here.  The value of libao
    is that it's portable for applications, not that it offers an infinite
    variety of ways to do that, but let's see what happens.  Closes: #802473
  * Ignore unknown config options when using pulse.  Closes: #650301

    which has fixes for building the ppc64le architecture.  Closes: #752022

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Aug 2014 17:43:13 +0930

libao (1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopting this package with the blessing of John.
    Leaving him in uploaders because he's busy, not disinterested, but putting
    myself in the hotseat for any reports related to this one now.
  * End the grief with roar.
    Too many people now have been through all the stages of Denial, Anger,
    Bargaining, and Depression with it, so it's time to accept the only
    sensible course of direct action that remains to preserve sanity.
    Closes: #667039
  * Pull upstream update to libao.conf.5, Closes: #636917

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Jun 2012 20:36:50 +0930

    subdirectory of it.
